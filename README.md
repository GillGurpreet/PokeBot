# PokeBot Description
PokeBot is a bot made for Discord users. It can be added to any discord server, and users can create their own profile and start catch Pokemon! Commands include: ;pokemon, ;quests, ;shop, ;items, ;daily, ;streaks, ;hiscores, ;trade and more! 

This repository does not include all of the original files/commits of the repository and is intended to show pieces of the full bot, to avoid any source code theft and redistribution.

Personal project created by Gurpreet Gill and developed with help from Sherry Ma.
